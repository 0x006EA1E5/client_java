TODO: This section will contain information on:

* Mapping Prometheus metric names to OpenTelemetry when using the `OpenTelemetryExporter`. See OpenTelemetry's [Prometheus and OpenMetrics Compatibility](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/compatibility/prometheus_and_openmetrics/).
* Using dots in label and metric names to implement OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions.
