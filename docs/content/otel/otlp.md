TODO: This section will describe how to push metrics to an OpenTelemetry endpoint using the OpenTelemetry exporter.

In the meantime, have a look at the example in [examples/example-exporter-opentelemetry](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/tree/main/examples/example-exporter-opentelemetry).
It has an example Java program with the `OpenTelemetryExporter`, and a Docker compose setting up a pipeline with the OpenTelemetry collector and a Prometheus server.
